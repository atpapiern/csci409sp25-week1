1. I chose the Pokemon API (pokeapi) because I am familiar with pokemon
    and thought it would be cool.

2. The script's intent is to ask the user how many random pokemon they would like to view.
    It then retrieves information about the pokemon for the number of pokemon requested.
    Then outputs each pokemon into the console and then into a .json file

    1. Asks user how many pokemon they would like to view
    2. Checks if it was an int then changes the type. If not, it repeats the input line.
    3. For each pokemon, it requests the pokemon info from pokeapi.
    4. For the pokemon instance, it gets the name, id, and type of the pokemon and stores it as variables and then in the pokelist.
    5. Prints the variables and then starts a new instance.
    6. At the end, creates a .json file and puts the entire pokelist in it. 

3. I had not used API in a python setting before, so this was definitely a little challenge to start.
    Once I learned basic syntax of getting the information it was not so bad.

    I also was not too familiar working with the .json file format but it was also not so bad figuring out.
